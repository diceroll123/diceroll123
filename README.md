### Hi there, I'm Steve üëã

- I'm a self-taught Senior Software Engineer at a data company! _The good kind of data company, I swear!_
- I'm pretty good with Python üêç, and I'm learning Rust ü¶Ä.
- Slowly getting good at vim motions. One day, I'll be unstoppable!
- In my free time I enjoy working on hobby projects or contributing to open source projects that I like to use, most recently that would be [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) ‚ö°Ô∏è, the Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
-  For some reason I enjoy playing dead games, like Heroes of the Storm.
